        content: "Chemistry is the study of matter and the changes it undergoes. It is involved in cooking, cleaning, breathing, rusting, and even the way your body digests food. For example, when bread bakes, the carbohydrates and proteins change structure. When iron is exposed to moisture and oxygen, it rusts. These are both examples of chemistry in action."
    },
    {
        title: "Lesson 2: Physical Change vs Chemical Change",
        content: "A physical change changes the form or appearance of a substance but does not produce a new substance. Examples include melting ice, cutting paper, and dissolving sugar in water. A chemical change creates a new substance with different properties. Examples include burning wood, digesting food, and baking a cake. In a chemical change, the atoms are rearranged to form something new."
    },
    {
        title: "Lesson 3: Signs of a Chemical Reaction",
        content: "Chemical reactions can be identified by observing evidence. A color change can show a new substance has formed, such as when iron rusts or leaves turn brown in autumn. Bubbles may indicate a gas is being released. A temperature change may show that energy is being absorbed or released. A precipitate, which is a solid that forms in a liquid, is another sign of a chemical reaction."
